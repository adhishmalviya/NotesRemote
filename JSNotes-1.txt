#1.
Note the difference between (x==y) and (x===y).
Comparing two JavaScript objects will always return false.


#2. If you access a method without the () parentheses, it will return the function definition.


#3. JavaScript Numbers are Always 64-bit Floating Point

#4. Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).
let and const are not hoisted, using them before declaring will cause refrenece error.


#5. The keyword const is a little misleading.

It does NOT define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.

Because of this, we cannot change constant primitive values, but we can change the properties of constant objects.
